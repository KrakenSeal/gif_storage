# Gif Storage Application

This is a simple Angular application for saving and managing your personal gif collection. You can easily add new gifs to your collection by clicking on the "Add Gif" button located at the end of the toolbar. 

## Adding a New Gif

When adding a new gif, you have two options: 

1. Manually enter all the data for the gif. 

2. Load a gif from Giphy. By default, the application fetches trending gifs from Giphy. However, you can also search for specific gifs by inputting a search request. 

## Managing Your Gif Collection

Once you've added gifs to your collection, you can easily manage them. 

1. To modify the metadata for a gif, simply click on the card for that gif. 

2. To download a gif or delete a gif, click on the corresponding buttons on the gif card. 

## Sorting Your Collection

You can sort your gif collection in any way you'd like. 

1. To use the default sorting method, simply select the desired "Sorting" option. 

2. To use a custom sorting method, select the "Custom" option. You can then sort your gifs in any order you'd like by dragging and dropping the gif cards. This custom sorting order will be saved for future use. 

Enjoy your personalized gif collection!
